## :loudspeaker: Introduction

The **Number Guessing Game** is a single-page web application where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the number, and with each incorrect guess, they receive a hint whether the correct number is higher or lower than their guess. The gmae also remembers and record a highscore from game to game which changes when beaten.
