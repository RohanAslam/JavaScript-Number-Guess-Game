Introduction
The Number Guessing Game is a single-page web application where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the number, and with each incorrect guess, they receive a hint whether the correct number is higher or lower than their guess. Their highscore is saved and will be carried over game to game and changes when beaten.
